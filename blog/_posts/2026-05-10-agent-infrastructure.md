## The Short Answer

Because buying solutions was too expensive, and existing tools didn't fit my workflow.

## The Long Answer

I've been working with AI agents for over a year. Here's what I learned:

### 1. Cloud AI Services Are Expensive
- OpenAI API: $0.01-0.10 per 1K tokens
- Anthropic: similar pricing
- At 1000 conversations/day, that's $300-3000/month

### 2. Self-Hosting Is Cheaper But Complex
Running open models locally:
- Hardware cost: $500-2000 (one-time)
- Electricity: ~$20/month
- Maintenance: ??? (depends on your skill)

### 3. The Agent Framework Landscape is Fragmented
- LangChain: powerful but heavy
- AutoGen: Microsoft research, not production-ready
- CrewAI: trendy but young
- Custom: everything you need, nothing you don't

## My Solution: Hybrid Architecture

```

### Cost Analysis (Monthly)

| Provider | Cost | Quality | Uptime |
|----------|------|---------|--------|
| NVIDIA NIM | $50 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 99.9% |
| Local Ollama | $20 | ⭐⭐⭐ | 95% |
| Free APIs | $0 | ⭐⭐ | 70% |

**Total: ~$70/month for reliable, high-quality AI**

## The Skills System

What makes Hermès special is the skills architecture:

```
skills/
├── trending-radar/     # Main content aggregator
│   ├── SKILL.md        # Entry point
│   └── references/     # Supporting docs
├── github/            # GitHub workflow
├── data-science/       # Analysis tools
└── 60+ more...
```

Each skill is:
- Self-contained
- Documented
- Testable
- Composable

## What I've Achieved

1. **24/7 monitoring** of tech news
2. **Automated code reviews** on GitHub
3. **Trend detection** before viral moments
4. **Zero-vendor-lock-in** architecture

## The Future

Building your own AI agent infrastructure isn't for everyone. But if you:
- Have technical skills
- Care about cost efficiency
- Want full control

It's worth the investment.
